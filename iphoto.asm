; Bitmap Display Program        (bitmap.asm)

; The ShowBMP procedure loads a Windows type BMP file
; and display it on the screen. Input parameters: 
; DS:DX points to an ASCIIZ string containing the 
; BMP file path. The maximum resolution is 320x200, with 
; 256 colors. (by Diego Escala, Miami, Florida)
